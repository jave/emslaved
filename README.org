* Emslaved

Emslaved is meant to be some bits and pieces to control a laptop from
an emacs instance running on a server.

its not immediately clear how to do this, so theres a bit of
experimentation going on here.

The pieces so far:
- emslaved-ff :: a web extension to control a client firefox instance


** failed experiments
some stuff didnt go too well, so i document for posterity.
- encumberurls.sh :: manipulate iptables, in order to enable/disable
     urls on the laptop. this method is too harsh.

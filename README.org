* Emslaved

Emslaved is meant to be some bits and pieces to control a laptop from
an emacs instance running on a server.

its not immediately clear how to do this, so theres a bit of
experimentation going on here.

** emslaved-ff
a web extension to control a client firefox instance.
atm you get a button that disables/enables a couple of urls in ff.
controlling from the server is WIP.

about:debugging, load temporary add on. select a file in the
emslaved-ff dir, load it. you have to do this a lot so is tedious.


web-ext is a tool that can automate the thing.

** failed experiments
some stuff didnt go too well, so i document for posterity.
- encumberurls.sh :: manipulate iptables, in order to enable/disable
     urls on the laptop. this method is too harsh.
